> _Sync Remote and Local MongoDB Databases in Bash. Works with Heroku too!_

For all the Rubyists out there, I've converted this in to a [Ruby Gem](https://github.com/sheharyarn/mongo-sync-ruby) as well.

## Additional Features (addition to the oringnal repo)
- Support `authenticationDatabase` option

## Usage

- Download / Clone the script

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/j0e1in/mongo-sync.git
    cd mongo-sync
    ```

- Edit `config.yml` and insert your configuration details

- Use the script like this:
	
	```bash
	./mongo-sync push [options]		# Push DB to Remote
	./mongo-sync pull [options]		# Pull DB to Local
	```
- Options

	```
	-y  # Skip confirmation
	--config alternate-config-file.yml
	```

## Notes

 - `mongo-sync` requires `mongodump` and `mongorestore` binaries to be installed in your system. If you have [`mongodb`](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/#getting-started) installed, then you probably already have them
 - Pushing/Pulling ***overwrites*** the Target DB
 - It's a good idea to keep your `config.yml` in `.gitignore` if you're using it inside some other project


## TODO

 - Add a `--no-overwrite` flag+feature that doesn't drop the target db before restoring it, and *actually* tries to sync it
 - Add a `backup` command and an `--auto-backup` feature
 - Add more options for Local DB in `config.yml`
